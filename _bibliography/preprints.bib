  abstract={The tunneling time problem earlier studied in Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 170402 (2012) using a non-relativistic time-of-arrival (TOA) operator predicted that tunneling time is instantaneous implying that the wavepacket becomes superluminal below the barrier. The non-relativistic treatment raises the question whether the superluminal behavior is a mere non-relativistic phenomenon or an an inherent quantum effect in all energy scales. Here we extend the analysis by constructing a relativistic TOA-operator for spin-0 particles across a square potential barrier by quantizing the corresponding classical quantity, and imposing that the barrier height Vo is less than the rest mass energy. We show that only the above barrier energy components of the incident wavepacket's momentum distribution contribute to the barrier traversal time while the below barrier components are transmitted instantaneously. },

  abstract={We provide a full account of our recent report (arXiv:2207.09040) which constructed a quantized relativistic time-of-arrival operator for spin-0 particles using a modified Weyl-ordering rule to calculate the traversal time across a square barrier. It was shown that the tunneling time of a relativistic spin-0 particle is instantaneous under the condition that the barrier height Vo is less than the rest mass energy. This implies that instantaneous tunneling is an inherent quantum effect in the context of arrival times. },
