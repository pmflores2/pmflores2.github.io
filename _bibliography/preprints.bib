  abstract={We provide a full account of our recent report (arXiv:2207.09040) which constructed a quantized relativistic time-of-arrival operator for spin-0 particles using a modified Weyl-ordering rule to calculate the traversal time across a square barrier. It was shown that the tunneling time of a relativistic spin-0 particle is instantaneous under the condition that the barrier height Vo is less than the rest mass energy. This implies that instantaneous tunneling is an inherent quantum effect in the context of arrival times. },
