  abstract={The tunneling time problem earlier studied in Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 170402 (2012) using a non-relativistic time-of-arrival (TOA) operator predicted that tunneling time is instantaneous implying that the wavepacket becomes superluminal below the barrier. The non-relativistic treatment raises the question whether the superluminal behavior is a mere non-relativistic phenomenon or an an inherent quantum effect in all energy scales. Here we extend the analysis by constructing a relativistic TOA-operator for spin-0 particles across a square potential barrier by quantizing the corresponding classical quantity, and imposing that the barrier height Vo is less than the rest mass energy. We show that only the above barrier energy components of the incident wavepacket's momentum distribution contribute to the barrier traversal time while the below barrier components are transmitted instantaneously. },

  abstract={A relativistic version of the Aharonov-Bohm time-of-arrival operator for spin-0 particles was constructed by Razavi [Il Nuovo Cimento B 63, 271 (1969)]. We study the operator in detail by taking its rigged Hilbert space extension. It is shown that the rigged Hilbert space extension of the operator provides more insights into the time-of-arrival problem that goes beyond Razavi's original results. This allows us to use time-of-arrival eigenfunctions that exhibit unitary arrival to construct time-of-arrival distributions. The expectation value is also calculated and shown that particles can arrive earlier or later than expected classically. Last, the constructed time-of-arrival distribution and expectation value are shown to be consistent with special relativity.},

  abstract={The weak equivalence principle (WEP) in the quantum regime has been the subject of many studies with a broad range of approaches to the problem. Here, we tackle the problem anew through the time of arrival (TOA) operator approach. This is done by constructing the TOA operator for a nonrelativistic and structureless particle that is projected upward in a uniform gravitational field with an intended arrival point below the classical turning point. The TOA operator is constructed under the constraint that the inertial and gravitational masses are equivalent and that Galilean invariance is preserved. These constraints are implemented by Weyl quantization of the corresponding classical TOA function for the projectile. The expectation value of the TOA operator is explicitly shown to be equal to the classical time of arrival plus mass-dependent quantum correction terms, implying incompatibility of the WEP with quantum mechanics. The full extent of the violation of the WEP is shown through the mass dependence of TOA distribution for the projectile.},

  abstract={We demonstrate that the quantum corrections to the classical arrival time for a quantum object in a potential free region of space, as computed in Phys. Rev. A 80, 030102(R) (2009), can be eliminated up to a given order of ‚Ñè by choosing an appropriate position-dependent phase for the object's wave function. This then implies that we can make the quantum arrival time of the object as close as possible to its corresponding classical arrival time, allowing us to synchronize a classical and quantum clock, which tells time using the classical and quantum arrival time of the object, respectively. We provide an example for synchronizing such a clock by making use of a quantum object with a position-dependent phase imprinted on the object's initial wave function with the use of an impulsive potential.},
