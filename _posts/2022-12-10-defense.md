My Dissertation is entitled `Theory of quantized relativistic time-of-arrival operators for spin-0 particles and its application in the quantum tunneling time problem`, and the Doctoral Examination was held online via Zoom last December 5, 2022. For those interested, you can download my slides [here]({{ '/assets/pdf/presentation.pdf' | relative_url }})
