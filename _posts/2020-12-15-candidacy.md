My candidacy exam was held online via zoom last December 15, 2020. For those interested, you can download my slides [here]({{ '/assets/pdf/presentation.pdf' | relative_url }}). The goal of this talk was to present how time is a fundamental problem in physics by discussing the different problems of time that arise in the context of different theories.  

The unification of quantum field theory and general relativity, which supposedly yields quantum gravity, still remains problematic. A possible source of this complication is the mismatch of the notion of time in quantum theory and general relativity. Relativity treats time to be dynamical and on equal footing with space, i.e. special relativity treats time and space as components of a 4-vector that transforms covariantly under Lorentz transforms while time in general relativity is influenced by the geometry of spacetime which allows material clocks to display proper time.

Time in quantum theory is absolute and treated as an external parameter which governs the evolution of the system. Despite this parametric treatment of time, we have the well-known time-energy uncertainty relation

$$
\Delta E \Delta t \geq \dfrac{\hbar}{2}
$$

which is not deduced from the commutation relation of operators but is nonetheless accepted to be valid. This uncertainty relation plays a central role in our understanding of time in quantum theory. In non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the time-energy uncertainty relation leads to the problem of constructing a corresponding self-adjoint time operator that is canonically conjugate with the Hamiltonian. In relativistic quantum mechancis, it manifests itself in the localization problem. Lastly, in quantum field theory, it manifests as the number-phase uncertainty.

In the context of quantum gravity, the problem of time is that there is no time. Canonical quantization of gravity yields the Wheeler DeWitt equation which is a constraint equation that annihilates all physical states. This equation means that the universe is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian and that the Hamiltonian does not generate time translation, i.e. the universe is "frozen" in time.  

If the universe is “frozen” in time, then how do we explain the dynamics that we experience? This was addressed by Page and Wootters. They did this by using a clock to correlate its initial state to the initial state of a system S. One can then construct a Hamiltonian that when a measurement on the clock is performed, the system collapses onto a time-evolved state that we expect. By doing so, we get the interpretation that time is an emergent phenomenon.

This then leads us to two central questions regarding time: (1) how should the notion of time be reintroduced? Maybe introduce a notion of dynamical time in quantum theory or an absolute time in GR, and (2) is time a fundamental concept or is it purely phenomenological, i.e. time is just an illusion?


<!-- Pauli concluded that a self-adjoint time operator that is canonically conjugate with the Hamiltonian cannot exist


However, time demonstrates a non-parametric aspect in radioactivity. The time at which a radioactive particle decays is inherently random and a measurement of the decay time an ensemble of similar particles is distributed. Aside from decay time, time also demonstrates a non-parametric aspect when measuring the occurrence of an event such as arrival time, tunneling time, and escape time. -->
