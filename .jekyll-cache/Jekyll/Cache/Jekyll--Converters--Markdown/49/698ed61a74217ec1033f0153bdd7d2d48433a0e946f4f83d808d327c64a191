I"t<p>The title of my thesis was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Weak equivalence principle in the quantum regime: Compatibility with quantum mechanics, and tunneling effects via the different quantizations of the time of arrival operator</code>. The weak equivalence principle (WEP) in the quantum regime has been the subject of many studies with a broad range of approaches to the problem. In the thesis, we tackle the problem anew using a time-operator based theory of quantum time of arrival.</p>

<p>Classically, the time of arrival at the origin for a non-relativistic point particle that is projected upward with initial velocity \(v = v_o\) at an initial postion \(q = -q_o\) is given by</p>

\[t_{\pm} = \dfrac{v_o}{g} \left( 1 \pm \sqrt{1-2g \dfrac{q_o}{v_o^2}} \right),\]

<p>where \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity. The toa \(t_{-}\) indicates the first time crossing of the particle at the origin while \(t_{+}\) indicates the second time crossing as the particle falls down after reaching the classical turning point.</p>

<p>Various TOA operators were constructed using supraquantization, and quantization by Weyl, Born-Jordan, and simple symmetric ordering rules. The expectation value of the TOA operators were explicitly shown to be equal to the classical time of arrival plus mass-dependent quantum correction terms, implying incompatibility of the WEP. The full extent of the violation of the WEP was shown via the mass dependence of the TOA distribution.</p>

<p>I was able to publish a paper on <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.99.042113">Physical Review A</a> and two conference proceedings from this thesis. I also presented part of this thesis during the poster session of the conference <a href="http://www.weizmann.ac.il/conferences/TFQM19/">Time and Fundamentals of Quantum Mechanics</a> which was held at the Weizmann Institute of Science.</p>
