<p>My Dissertation is entitled <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Theory of quantized relativistic time-of-arrival operators for spin-0 particles and its application in the quantum tunneling time problem</code>, and the Doctoral Examination was held online via Zoom last December 5, 2022. Here are my <a href="/assets/pdf/slides.pdf">slides</a> for those who are interested.</p>

<p>Tunneling is one of the most well known quantum effects and has been a long standing important subject of quantum mechanics. However, tunneling becomes problematic when one associates the time it takes a wavepacket to traverse the classically forbidden region, i.e. the quantum tunneling time problem (TTP). It is further complicated because it is compounded with the quantum time problem, and superluminality. Standard quantum mechanics only treats time as a parameter, as such, the TTP may be ill-defined because there is no canonical formalism in standard quantum mechanics to answer questions regarding time durations. This has led to several definitions of tunneling time using
a parametric approach, e.g. Wigner phase time, B"uttiker-Landauer time, Larmor time, Pollak-Miller time, among many others. The relationship between these proposed tunneling times is still not clear and several experiments to measure the tunneling has also not settled the problem because some report instantaneous tunneling while some report non-zero but superluminal tunneling times. Whichever the case, the crux of the problem is both instantaneous and non-zero tunneling times imply superluminal behavior under the barrier. This raises the question on whether the apparent superluminality is a consequence of using a non-relativistic theory.</p>

<p>In order to address all these compounding problems, we treat tunneling as a time-of-arrival problem and develop a formalism on the construction of relativistic time-of-arrival operators via quantization. This is done by inverting the Hamiltonian of special relativity and utilizing the rigged Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics. We showed that despite a relativistic treatment, the tunneling time across a square barrier is instantaneous provided that the barrier height is less than the rest mass energy of the particle.</p>
