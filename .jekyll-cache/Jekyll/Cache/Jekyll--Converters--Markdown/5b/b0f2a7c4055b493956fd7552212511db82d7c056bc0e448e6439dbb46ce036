I"å	<p>I studied at the <a href="http://nip.upd.edu.ph/">National Institute of Physics</a>, <a href="https://upd.edu.ph/">University of the Philippines Diliman</a> where I obtained my BS (2017), MS (2019), and PhD (2023) degrees under the supervision of <a href="http://nip.upd.edu.ph/profiles/eric-a-galapon/">Eric A. Galapon, PhD</a>. My research is on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">quantum time of arrival operators</code> which were used to investigate the quantum violation of the weak equivalence principle, and the tunneling time problem. You can download my CV <a href="/assets/pdf/My_CV_v2.pdf">here</a> for more details.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of this blog is to hopefully help me <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">organize my thoughts</code> while doing research. By doing so, I hope to gain a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">better understanding</code> of the very same topics I am writing about, e.g. explainers of some papers and topics that I find interesting so feel free to check out my <a href="/blog/">blog</a> and write a comment.</p>

<p>Aside from physics, my interests include watching <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">movies</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">anime</code>, reading <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">manga</code>, playing computer <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">games</code>, and customizing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gunpla</code> (gundam plastic models).</p>

<!-- I am currently a physics PhD candidate at the [University of the Philippines Diliman](https://upd.edu.ph/) and a member of the [Theoretical Physics Group](https://niptheorygroup.wordpress.com/) under the supervision of [Eric A. Galapon, PhD](http://nip.upd.edu.ph/profiles/eric-a-galapon/). I obtained my BS and MS degrees in 2017 and 2019, respectively, doing research on `quantum time of arrival`. You can download my CV [here](/assets/pdf/My_CV_v2.pdf).

The primary purpose of this blog is to hopefully help me `organize my thoughts` while doing research. By doing so, I hope to gain a `better understanding` of the very same topics I am writing about, e.g. explainers of some papers and topics that I find interesting so feel free to check out my [blog](/blog/) and write a comment.   

Aside from physics, my interests include watching `movies` and `anime`, reading `manga`, playing computer `games`, and customizing `gunpla` (gundam plastic models). -->
