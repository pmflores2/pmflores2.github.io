I"X<!-- Classical mechanics treats time only as a parameter. Meanwhile, time in special and general relativity acquires a dynamical concept. Special relativity treats time and space on equal footing as coordinates of a four-vector in special which are intertwined with each other under Lorentz transforms. Meanwhile, the geometry of spacetime affects the dynamics of time in general relativity and allows material clocks to display proper time. Now in quantum theory, time is still treated as a parameter in the same way as classical mechanics treats time. This parameter  t then governs the evolution of the system. These different treatment of time then poses a problem when physicists attempt to unify general relativity and quantum theory and constitutes one aspect of the problem of time in quantum gravity. We have different notions of time, such as entropic time, coordinate time, parametric time, and so on. One might argue that the problem of time might be because we are using a different notions of time which leads to confusion. To avoid this, we will only deal with the concept of time of arrival. -->
