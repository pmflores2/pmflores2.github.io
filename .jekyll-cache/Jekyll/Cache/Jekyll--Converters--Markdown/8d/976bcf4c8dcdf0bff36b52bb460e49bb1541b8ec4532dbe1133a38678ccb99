I"Æ<p>I am currently a physics PhD candidate at the <a href="https://upd.edu.ph/">University of the Philippines Diliman</a> and a member of the <a href="https://niptheorygroup.wordpress.com/">Theoretical Physics Group</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://nip.upd.edu.ph/profiles/eric-a-galapon/">Eric A. Galapon, PhD</a>. I obtained my BS and MS degrees in 2017 and 2019, respectively, doing research on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">quantum time of arrival</code>. You can download my CV <a href="/assets/pdf/My_CV_v2.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of this blog is to hopefully help me <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">organize my thoughts</code> while doing research. By doing so, I hope to gain a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">better understanding</code> of the very same topics I am writing about, e.g. explainers of some papers and topics that I find interesting so feel free to check out my <a href="/blog/">blog</a> and write a comment.</p>

<p>Aside from physics, my interests include watching <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">movies</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">anime</code>, reading <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">manga</code>, playing computer <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">games</code>, and customizing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gunpla</code> (gundam plastic models).</p>
