By calculating the time it takes for a particle to reach a specific point under gravity, we found small mass-dependent differences that suggest the WEP doesn't hold perfectly in quantum mechanics. These findings show that quantum effects can lead to a violation of the WEP."},{"name":"Über einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt","publisher":"Annalen der Physik","releaseDate":"1905-03-18","url":"https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Über_einen_die_Erzeugung_und_Verwandlung_des_Lichtes_betreffenden_heuristischen_Gesichtspunkt","summary":"In the second paper, he applied the quantum theory to light to explain the photoelectric effect.
