The title of my thesis was `Weak equivalence principle in the quantum regime: Compatibility with quantum mechanics, and tunneling effects via the different quantizations of the time of arrival operator`. The weak equivalence principle (WEP) in the quantum regime has been the subject of many studies with a broad range of approaches to the problem. In the thesis, we tackle the problem anew using a time-operator based theory of quantum time of arrival.

Classically, the time of arrival at the origin for a non-relativistic point particle that is projected upward with initial velocity $$ v = v_o $$ at an initial postion $$ q = -q_o$$ is given by

$$ t_{\pm} = \dfrac{v_o}{g} \left( 1 \pm \sqrt{1-2g \dfrac{q_o}{v_o^2}} \right),$$

where $$ g $$ is the acceleration due to gravity. The toa $$t_{-}$$ indicates the first time crossing of the particle at the origin while $$t_{+}$$ indicates the second time crossing as the particle falls down after reaching the classical turning point.

Various TOA operators were constructed using supraquantization, and quantization by Weyl, Born-Jordan, and simple symmetric ordering rules. The expectation value of the TOA operators were explicitly shown to be equal to the classical time of arrival plus mass-dependent quantum correction terms, implying incompatibility of the WEP. The full extent of the violation of the WEP was shown via the mass dependence of the TOA distribution.

I was able to publish a paper on [Physical Review A](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.99.042113) and two conference proceedings from this thesis. I also presented part of this thesis during the poster session of the conference [Time and Fundamentals of Quantum Mechanics](http://www.weizmann.ac.il/conferences/TFQM19/) which was held at the Weizmann Institute of Science.
