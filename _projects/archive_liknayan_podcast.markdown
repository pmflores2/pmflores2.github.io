### **About us**

[Liknayan Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@liknayan.podcast) is a science communication initiative focused on physics that shines the spotlight on Pinoy Physicists by showcasing their research, insights, and fascinating journey in science. This podcast is co-hosted by Philip Flores, [Reggie Bernardo](https://reggiebernardo.github.io/), [Cherrie Olaya](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e78jVyoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Jane Garcia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x6ozmB4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), and [Frankie Palabrica](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesca-palabrica-165160a1/), with Mika San Diego as the graphic artist.


`Liknayan` is the Filipino word for physics and is a blend of the words `likas` which means natural, and `hanayan` which is associated to organizing and tallying. Our dedication to Liknayan Podcast stems from our shared passion for communicating the remarkable work of Pinoy physicists, driven by our commitment to inspire the next generation of students to pursue careers in science. Our conversations are conducted in Filipino, and we simplify complex concepts to make physics more accessible and enjoyable for everyone. 

For general inquiries, partnerships, and collaborations, please contact us at `liknayan.podcast@gmail.com`.

      <a href="https://reggiebernardo.github.io/">Reggie</a> earned his Bachelor’s, Master’s, and PhD in Physics from the University of the Philippines Diliman, where he also served as an Instructor and Assistant Professor. He is the first homegrown Filipino Gravitational Physicist. His doctoral research focused on compact objects, cosmologies, and gravitational perturbations within scalar-tensor theories of gravity. After PhD, he moved to Academia Sinica, Taiwan for his first postdoc venture and then to APCTP, Korea for a second/current one. His interests span cosmology, gravitational waves, dark energy, data analysis, machine learning, and physics education.

      <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e78jVyoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Cherrie</a> earned her Bachelor’s, Master’s, and PhD in Physics from the University of the Philippines Diliman, where she also served as an Instructor at the National Institute of Physics. Her doctoral research focused on developing an optical setup to simultaneously measure reflectivity and Goos-Hanchen (GH) shift, significantly enhancing the angular GH shift by exploiting the beam propagation dependence and focusing the incident beam to a small waist. She is currently a postdoctoral researcher at RIKEN, Japan, where she continues to explore beam displacements for detecting changes in material refractive indices.
