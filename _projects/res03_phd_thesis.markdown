It was previously shown in <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.170402">Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 170402 (2012)</a> that a time-of-arrival (TOA) operator approach to the quantum tunneling time problem predicts that only above-barrier energy components of an incident wavepacket contribute to the barrier traversal time. On the other hand, the contribution of the below-barrier components vanishes which implies an instantaneous tunneling time. This now raises the question on whether the supposed instantaneous tunneling time is a consequence of using a non-relativistic TOA-operator, that is, could there be a fundamental difference if one uses a relativistic TOA-operator? 

We address this question in my Dissertation entitled `Theory of quantized relativistic time-of-arrival operators for spin-0 particles and its application in the quantum tunneling time problem`. The entire approach is based on our proposed formalism of quantized relativistic TOA-operators which was done by inverting the equation of motion of special relativity to obtain an expression for the TOA, i.e.,

$$ t = -\text{sgn}p \int_x^q \dfrac{dq}{c} \left( 1 - \dfrac{\mu_o^2 c^4}{ (H(q,p) - V(q'))^2 } \right)^{-1/2} $$

wherein, $$x$$ is the arrival point, $$q$$ is the initial position, $$\mu_o$$ is the rest mass, $$c$$ is the speed of light in vacuum, $$\text{sgn}(z)$$ is the sigunum function, $$V(q)$$ is the interaction potential, and the Hamiltonian is $$H(q,p)=\sqrt{p^2 c^2 + \mu_o^2 c^4} + V(q)$$.

The main result of my Dissertation is summarized in this <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1209/0295-5075/acad9a">Letter</a> while the full details are outlined in this <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00343">preprint</a>. Moreover, a detailed study of the free case can be found <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.105.062208">here</a>.

I was also able to present my research during the poster session of the conference <a href="https://tqt2022conference.wordpress.com/">Time in Quantum Theory 2022</a> which was held at the Technical University of Vienna.
