#### **Philippine Science High School**
##### *Western Visayas Campus*

The <a href="https://pshs.edu.ph/">Philippine Science High School (PSHS) system</a> is a network of specialized public high schools dedicated to nurturing the country's future leaders in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). It currently has 16 campuses around the country, with my alma mater being the <a href="https://wvc.pshs.edu.ph/">Western Visayas Campus</a>. I gave a webinar on October 3, 2023, to share my experience in pursuing a career in physics research.
