[Liknayan Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@liknayan.podcast) is a science communication initiative focused on physics that shines the spotlight on Pinoy Physicists by showcasing their research, insights, and fascinating journey in science. This podcast is co-hosted by Philip Flores, [Reggie Bernardo](https://reggiebernardo.github.io/), [Cherrie Olaya](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e78jVyoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Jane Garcia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x6ozmB4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), and [Frankie Palabrica](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesca-palabrica-165160a1/), with Mika San Diego as the graphic artist.


`Liknayan` is the Filipino word for physics and is a blend of the words `likas` which means natural, and `hanayan` which is associated to organizing and tallying. Our dedication to Liknayan Podcast stems from our shared passion for communicating the remarkable work of Pinoy physicists, driven by our commitment to inspire the next generation of students to pursue careers in science. Our conversations are conducted in Filipino, and we simplify complex concepts to make physics more accessible and enjoyable for everyone.
