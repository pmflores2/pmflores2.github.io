I obtained my BS (2017), MS (2019), and PhD (2023) in Physics from the [National Institute of Physics](http://nip.upd.edu.ph/), [University of the Philippines Diliman](https://upd.edu.ph/), under the guidance of [Eric A. Galapon, PhD](http://nip.upd.edu.ph/profiles/eric-a-galapon/). My research focused on `quantum time of arrival operators`, investigating the quantum violation of the weak equivalence principle and the tunneling time problem. 

Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max Born Institute for Nonlinear Optics and Short Pulse Spectroscopy](https://mbi-berlin.de/homepage), supervised by [Prof. Dr. Olga Smirnova](https://mbi-berlin.de/p/olgasmirnova). My work involves developing geometric concepts in the `photoionization of chiral molecules`.  

I have also recently ventured into `science communication` by co-founding the [Liknayan Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@liknayan.podcast) on YouTube with my colleagues [Reggie Bernardo](https://reggiebernardo.github.io/), [Cherrie Olaya](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e78jVyoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Jane Garcia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x6ozmB4AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), [Frankie Palabrica](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesca-palabrica-165160a1/), and Mika San Diego. Our goal is to inspire the next generation of Filipino students to pursue careers in physics.

You can download my CV [here]({{ '/assets/pdf/FloresCV.pdf' | relative_url }}). Beyond physics, I enjoy watching movies and anime, reading manga, playing computer games, and customizing Gundam plastic models (Gunpla).
